# Installing Lua For Barotrauma Manually

## Notice: Using the LuaForBarotrauma package is not required if it's installed manually, but you may use it anyway if you wish to support the mod, since players automatically download packages when joining the server.

## If you are getting TextManager errors, open config_player.xml in your server and change the language from None to English

6 - Optional: Copy config_player.xml from your original game so it retains your configurations.

7 - Done! Now run DedicatedServer.exe to run the modded server or run Barotrauma.exe to run the modded client.<br>

### Linux notice
Sometimes you will get steam initialization errors, most of the time it's because it's missing the linux64/steamclient.so binary, so you can just copy the binary from your steam instalation over to the folder and it should work.



## Checking if everything is working

If the commands `reloadlua` or `cl_reloadlua` work without errors, it means you successfully installed the mod.

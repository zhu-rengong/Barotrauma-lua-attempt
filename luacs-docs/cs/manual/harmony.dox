# Using Harmony

This is the main way you will be modifying the game. Harmony is a library that allows you to patch methods in the game's code. This allows you to change the behavior of the game without modifying the game's code directly.

You can find the Harmony documentation here https://harmony.pardeike.net/articles/basics.html it should explain everything you need to know about Harmony and how to use it.
